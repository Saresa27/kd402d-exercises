// Exercise 7: a chord

// synth plays one note at a time, like one voice singing. That's all Tuesday's riff needed.
// A chord is several notes sounding at the same time. For that we need chordSynth, made in
// setup.js: a PolySynth ("poly" means many), which can play several notes at once.
const bottomNote = "c4";
const middleNote = "e4";
const topNote = "g4";

  chordSynth.triggerAttackRelease(middleNote, "2n", start);
  chordSynth.triggerAttackRelease(topNote, "2n", start);
}

// TODO 7a: play exercise 7 as it is. How many notes do you hear? Read the red error in the console.
// TODO 7b: in exercise7, change synth to chordSynth in all three calls. Play again.
// TODO 7c: glue the three notes into one string, with a space between each, and log it:
//            const chord = bottomNote + " " + middleNote + " " + topNote;
// TODO 7d: log chord.toUpperCase(), then chord.length. Predict the length first: do the spaces count?
// TODO 7e: log chord one last time. Has toUpperCase changed it?
