// Blue track: B1 and B2
// beat and bpm come from exercise3.js. Every file on the page can use the variables the others make.

// TODO B1: a phrase is 12 beats long. Work out how long it lasts in seconds from beat,
//          round it to a whole number of seconds, and log it.
let phrase = beat * 12;
console.log("a 12 beat phrase lasts " + Math.round(phrase) + " seconds");

// TODO B2: store a title and a key for your track (you already have bpm), then log one line like:
//          Night Bus · 90 BPM · A minor
let title = "cutie";
let key = "A major";
console.log(title + " " + bpm + "BPM" + " " + key);
